# üîç **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of **objects**, which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods). 

OOP allows for:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling of data with methods that operate on that data.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts.
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones, inheriting properties and behaviors.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.

OOP makes software development more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
