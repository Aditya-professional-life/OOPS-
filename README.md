# üîç **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of **objects**, which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods). 

OOP allows for:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling of data with methods that operate on that data.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts.
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones, inheriting properties and behaviors.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to process objects differently based on their data type or class.

OOP makes software development more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.



# üß† **Why is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Required?**

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is required because it provides several advantages that improve software development:

- **Modularity**: Code can be divided into reusable modules (classes) that reduce redundancy.
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured code is easier to update and maintain over time.
- **Reusability**: Classes and objects can be reused across different programs, reducing development time.
- **Scalability**: OOP allows for easier modification and expansion of code as applications grow.
- **Security**: Encapsulation hides sensitive data from external interference, enhancing security.

OOP encourages organized, efficient, and collaborative coding, making it essential for modern software development.
